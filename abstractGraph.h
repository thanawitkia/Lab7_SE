 *    bDirected    - If true this is a directed graph.

 *     pData -   Additional information that can
 *               be associated with the vertex.
 * Returns 1 unless there is an error, in which case
 * it returns a 0. An error could mean a memory allocation

 * is not found. Returns -1 if an edge already
